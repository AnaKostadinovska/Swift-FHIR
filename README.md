FHIR Swift Classes
==================

These are [Swift](https://developer.apple.com/swift/) classes for data models of [FHIR](http://hl7.org/implement/standards/fhir/) elements and resources.
Classes are generated from the FHIR resource profiles and at one point should be able to instantiate themselves from JSON representations.


SMART on FHIR
-------------

The [SMART on FHIR](https://github.com/p2/SMART-on-FHIR-Cocoa) Cocoa framework utilizes these classes.
